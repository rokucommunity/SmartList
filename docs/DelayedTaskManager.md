# DelayedTaskManager

Class summary
-------------



The `DelayedTaskManager` class provides a way to schedule tasks to be executed at a later time. It does this by creating a timer node that will fire after a specified delay. When the timer fires, it creates a task node of a specified type and sets the fields provided on the task node. The task node is then added to the scene graph and executed. The `DelayedTaskManager` class also provides a method to cancel any tasks that have not yet been executed.



The `activeTimers` and `delayedTasks` private fields are used to store references to the timer and task nodes that have been created. This allows the `DelayedTaskManager` to cancel tasks if necessary.

The `scheduleDelayedTask` method is used to schedule a new task. It takes in the node type, ID, delay, fields, and result field for the task as arguments. If there is already an active timer or task with the same ID, it will be cancelled before the new task is scheduled.

The `cancelDelayedTaskWithId` method allows you to cancel a task with a given ID. It does this by cancelling any active timer and task nodes with the given ID.
