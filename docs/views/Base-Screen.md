# Base Screen

Class summary
-------------



`BaseScreen` is a class that serves as the base class for screens in an application. It is a subclass of `BaseView`, which is a class that serves as the base class for views in an application.



`BaseScreen` has a `state` field that is used to track the state of a view, and an `originSelection` field that is used to track the selection object that led to this view being created.

`BaseScreen` has several methods for navigating between screens, such as `push()`, which adds a new screen to the navigation stack, `pop()`, which removes the current screen from the navigation stack, and `dismiss()`, which dismisses the current screen. It also has a method called `cleanup()` that is called when the screen is removed from the navigation stack and is used to reset the state of the screen.

`BaseScreen` also has a `onKeyPressBack()` method that is called when the back key is pressed, and a default implementation of this method dismisses the current screen.

`BaseScreen` has an `initialize()` method that is called when the screen is created and sets the `originSelection` field to the `originSelection` field of the top-level scope.
