## Why maestro?

### Maestro Makes roku development easier, especially for experienced software engineers from other platforms:

I believe that experienced developers from android, ios, c#, web, node, etc, should be able to be productive on a roku app in no more than a week, just as they would on any other platform. So I wrote maestro to make that possible.

## Maestro is built to:

 - Raise velocity
 - Increase productivity
 - Reduce learning
 - Simply cross-skilling
 - Make roku development more fun
 - Produce roku apps that can be maintained by non roku developer
 - Produce roku apps that can be unit tested easily
 - Write code that can be tested and breakpoint debugged, outside of SG views (which are slow as hell, and prone to crashing when breakpoint debugging)


## Maestro is easy to use:

 - Delivered as ropm module for easy installation
 - Has sample app, which is ready to roll for production ready roku apps

## Maestro is aligned with community best practices and tools

 - Uses ropm
 - Written in [brighterscript](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript)
 - Uses brighterscript plugins for compile time and IDE diagnostics
 - No need for complex build scripts or bespoke build processes (like bash/gulp etc); maestro apps can run simply by executing `bsc`  (brighterscript compiler)


## Maestro is performant

 - Runs great on all roku devices
 - Maestro apps launch quick and are snappy

## Maestro is installed on millions of devices

Been in production for > 2 years at:
